# CTI-110-Final-Project.-Employee-Portal-and-Timesheet-Access
This is a final project for CTI-110. This program works with a previously created database.
Using the tables from the database, this program allows the user to add hours to a specific employee number.  
It also allows the user to search an EMPid or an employee ID and find the employee's information and hours worked. This also will display any hours that have been added.
This project will also include a previous lab which just displays a table with employees and their hours. The table will also update with any hours that have been added.
